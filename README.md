Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

This repository contains an implementation of a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:

Customer Segmentation Dataset
Overview

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. In this project, we aim to cluster customers using their purchasing behavior to identify distinct groups that may require different marketing strategies or personalized approaches.

Implementation Details

Dependencies
To run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
Download the Dataset:

Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the data/ directory.

Run the Code:

Execute the Python script customer_segmentation.py to perform customer segmentation using K-means clustering.

bash
Copy code
python customer_segmentation.py
Interpret Results:

After running the script, the results of customer segmentation will be displayed or saved as visualizations (e.g., cluster plots, distribution plots).

Results

The clustering results provide insights into different customer segments based on their purchase behavior. Each segment can be analyzed to understand their characteristics and preferences, which can inform targeted marketing strategies or product recommendations.
